                <h3 style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">
                    Electricity has transformed the world we live in. Ever since Thomas Edison created the world's first public power station in 1882 <sup><a href="https://pulseenergy.co.nz/our-blog/a-brief-history-of-electricity/">[1]</a></sup>, 
                    production of electricity has not only increased, but also diversified in source. Whilst the first power station was powered by burning coal, electricity can now be generated through a 
                    large variety of sources, both renewable and non-renewable. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Fossil fuels, or non-renewable energy sources, are considered to be Coal, Natural Gas and Oil. These sources come from decomposing plants and animals that are millions of years old. 
                    Renewable energy sources, on the other hand, are Biofuels, Hydroelectric Energy, Solar and Wind.

                <h4 style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; font-weight: 500;">
                    Unless otherwise specified, all electricity values are displayed in TeraWatt-Hours (TWh), which is 10^12 Watt-Hours. A Watt-Hour is a unit of measurement for electricity produced.
                    One Watt-Hour of electricity is the equivalent to the total electricity produced by a one watt electricity generator in one hour.

                            The plot on the left breaks down each country's annual electricity production by source. A large number of countries worldwide rely on coal as their primary source of electricity, on average producing 35% of a country's electricity worldwide in 2019.

Historically, <span style="color: #4c78a8; font-weight: bold;">Coal</span> has been extremely dominant due to its abundance, producing just under half of the world's total electricity in 1992.

                            In 1992, 4650.556 TWh of electricity was produced from <span style="color: #4c78a8; font-weight: bold;">Coal</span>, and just 1822.876 TWh was produced from <span style="color: #f58518; font-weight: bold;">Natural Gas</span>.
